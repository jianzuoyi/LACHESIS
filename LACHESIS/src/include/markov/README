This directory contains the 'markov' package, designed by Josh Burton.
The modules in the 'markov' package allow for the building of Markov models,
including Markov chains and hidden Markov models.

MODULES:

TestMarkovModel.cc
   An executable test script
MarkovModel
   A class describing a general Markov model
MarkovChain
   A class describing a Markov chain; subclass of MarkovModel
HMM
   A class describing a hidden Markov model; subclass of MarkovModel
WDAG
   (Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph) A helper class for HMM
SymbolSet
   Converter from HMM states to printable symbols; used only in TestMarkovModel



For more information about any of these modules, see the module's *.h file.
